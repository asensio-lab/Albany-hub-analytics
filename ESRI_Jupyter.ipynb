    "## Overview\n",
    "This is the Jupyter Notebook for the Georgia Tech ESRI Albany Hub Analytics and Visualization Project.  This version of the notebook incorporates a program analysis to quantify changes in energy use in Albany, GA among participants of HUD-funded programs. The first part implements matching algorithms that reduce observable bias in order to compare participants and non-participants.  The second part includes ArcGIS interactive visuals supplementing the analysis.  The visuals are intended to be used by cities to interpret results with spatial information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code here takes performance data from HUD-funded properties and compares them to properties that do not receive HUD funding but have been matched on similar attributes.  The matching attributes include variables such as baseline energy consumption prior to receiving HUD funding, property size in square feet, number of bedrooms, number of batherooms, year built, market value, and assessment value.  To validate the effectiveness of the matching procedures, the code also calculates the reductions in standardize bias for each of the matching variables with results shown before and after matching.  After a suitable matching model is selected, the code then estimates the energy savings by a difference-in-differences regression and also includes time dummies to control for seasonal trends in annual energy use.  \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Files Needed\n",
    "Two files are needed to utilize this code. The first file contains information about the properties before the treatment period used for matching. The second file needed is a panel dataset that contains the time-varying variables such as energy use during the pre- and post-treatment period. The records linkage between files is done with the AddressID field which indicates the unit of analysis is at the property level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Authentication\n",
    "In order to engage with the full interactive visuals generated by the code, an active ArcGIS account is necessary to establish a connection to the server.  You will be prompted to enter your password when creating the ArcGIS items from your data files.\n"
